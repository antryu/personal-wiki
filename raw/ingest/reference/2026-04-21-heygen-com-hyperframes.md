Hyperframes is an open-source video rendering framework that lets you create, preview, and render HTML-based video compositions — with first-class support for AI agents.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: With an AI coding agent (recommended)

Install the HyperFrames skills, then describe the video you want:

```bash
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes
```

This teaches your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex) how to write correct compositions and GSAP animations. In Claude Code, the skills register as slash commands — invoke `/hyperframes` to author compositions, `/hyperframes-cli` for CLI commands, and `/gsap` for animation help.

#### Try it: example prompts

Copy any of these into your agent to get started. The `/hyperframes` prefix loads the skill context explicitly so you get correct output the first time.

**Cold start — describe what you want:**

> Using `/hyperframes`, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title, a background video, and background music.

**Warm start — turn existing context into a video:**

> Take a look at this GitHub repo https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes and explain its uses and architecture to me using `/hyperframes`.

> Summarize the attached PDF into a 45-second pitch video using `/hyperframes`.

> Turn this CSV into an animated bar chart race using `/hyperframes`.

**Format-specific:**

> Make a 9:16 TikTok-style hook video about [topic] using `/hyperframes`, with bouncy captions synced to a TTS narration.

**Iterate — talk to the agent like a video editor:**

> Make the title 2x bigger, swap to dark mode, and add a fade-out at the end.

> Add a lower third at 0:03 with my name and title.

The agent handles scaffolding, animation, and rendering. See the [prompting guide](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/guides/prompting) for more patterns.

### Option 2: Start a project manually

```bash
npx hyperframes init my-video
cd my-video
npx hyperframes preview      # preview in browser (live reload)
npx hyperframes render       # render to MP4
```

`hyperframes init` installs skills automatically, so you can hand off to your AI agent at any point.

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 22, FFmpeg

## Why Hyperframes?

- **HTML-native** — compositions are HTML files with data attributes. No React, no proprietary DSL.
- **AI-first** — agents already speak HTML. The CLI is non-interactive by default, designed for agent-driven workflows.
- **Deterministic rendering** — same input = identical output. Built for automated pipelines.
- **Frame Adapter pattern** — bring your own animation runtime (GSAP, Lottie, CSS, Three.js).

## Hyperframes vs Remotion

Hyperframes is inspired by [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev) — we used Remotion at HeyGen in production, learned a ton from it, and kept attribution comments in the source for the patterns it pioneered (Chrome launch flags, image2pipe → FFmpeg streaming, frame buffering). Both tools drive headless Chrome and both are deterministic. They differ on one decision: **what the primary author writes.** Remotion's bet is React components; Hyperframes' bet is HTML.

| Authoring                                             | HTML + CSS + GSAP              | React components (TSX)            |
| Build step                                            | None; `index.html` plays as-is | Required (bundler)                |
| Library-clock animations (GSAP, Anime.js, Motion One) | Seekable, frame-accurate       | Plays at wall-clock during render |
| Arbitrary HTML / CSS passthrough                      | Paste and animate              | Rewrite as JSX                    |
| Distributed rendering
