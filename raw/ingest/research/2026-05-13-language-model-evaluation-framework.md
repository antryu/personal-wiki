## Latest News 📣
- [2025/12] **CLI refactored** with subcommands (`run`, `ls`, `validate`) and YAML config file support via `--config`. See the [CLI Reference](./docs/interface.md) and [Configuration Guide](./docs/config_files.md).
- [2025/12] **Lighter install**: Base package no longer includes `transformers`/`torch`. Install model backends separately: `pip install lm_eval[hf]`, `lm_eval[vllm]`, etc.
- [2025/07] Added `think_end_token` arg to `hf` (token/str), `vllm` and `sglang` (str) for stripping CoT reasoning traces from models that support it.
- [2025/03] Added support for steering HF models!
- [2025/02] Added [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/) support!
- [2024/09] We are prototyping allowing users of LM Evaluation Harness to create and evaluate on text+image multimodal input, text output tasks, and have just added the `hf-multimodal` and `vllm-vlm` model types and `mmmu` task as a prototype feature. We welcome users to try out this in-progress feature and stress-test it for themselves, and suggest they check out [`lmms-eval`](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval), a wonderful project originally forking off of the lm-evaluation-harness, for a broader range of multimodal tasks, models, and features.
- [2024/07] [API model](docs/API_guide.md) support has been updated and refactored, introducing support for batched and async requests, and making it significantly easier to customize and use for your own purposes. **To run Llama 405B, we recommend using VLLM's OpenAI-compliant API to host the model, and use the `local-completions` model type to evaluate the model.**
- [2024/07] New Open LLM Leaderboard tasks have been added ! You can find them under the [leaderboard](lm_eval/tasks/leaderboard/README.md) task group.

## Announcement

**A new v0.4.0 release of lm-evaluation-harness is available** !

New updates and features include:

- **New Open LLM Leaderboard tasks have been added ! You can find them under the [leaderboard](lm_eval/tasks/leaderboard/README.md) task group.**
- Internal refactoring
- Config-based task creation and configuration
- Easier import and sharing of externally-defined task config YAMLs
- Support for Jinja2 prompt design, easy modification of prompts + prompt imports from Promptsource
- More advanced configuration options, including output post-processing, answer extraction, and multiple LM generations per document, configurable fewshot settings, and more
- Speedups and new modeling libraries supported, including: faster data-parallel HF model usage, vLLM support, MPS support with HuggingFace, and more
- Logging and usability changes
- New tasks including CoT BIG-Bench-Hard, Belebele, user-defined task groupings, and more

Please see our updated documentation pages in `docs/` for more details.

Development will be continuing on the `main` branch, and we encourage you to give us feedback on what features are desired and how to improve the library further, or ask questions, either in issues or PRs on GitHub, or in the [EleutherAI discord](https://discord.gg/eleutherai)!

## Overview

This project provides a unified framework to test generative language models on a large number of different evaluation tasks.

**Features:**

- Over 60 standard academic benchmarks for LLMs, with hundreds of subtasks and variants implemented.
- Support for models loaded via [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/) (including quantization via [GPTQModel](https://github.com/ModelCloud/GPTQModel) and [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ)), [GPT-NeoX](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox), and [Megatron-DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/Megatron-DeepSpeed/), with a flexible tokenization-agnostic interface.
- Support for fast and memory-efficient inference with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
- Support for comm
