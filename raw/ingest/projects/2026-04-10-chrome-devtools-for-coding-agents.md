# Chrome DevTools MCP

[![npm chrome-devtools-mcp package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/chrome-devtools-mcp.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/chrome-devtools-mcp)

`chrome-devtools-mcp` lets your coding agent (such as Gemini, Claude, Cursor or Copilot)
control and inspect a live Chrome browser. It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol
(MCP) server, giving your AI coding assistant access to the full power of
Chrome DevTools for reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis.

## Key features

- **Get performance insights**: Uses [Chrome
  DevTools](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend) to record
  traces and extract actionable performance insights.
- **Advanced browser debugging**: Analyze network requests, take screenshots and
  check browser console messages (with source-mapped stack traces).
- **Reliable automation**. Uses
  [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to automate actions in
  Chrome and automatically wait for action results.

## Disclaimers

`chrome-devtools-mcp` exposes content of the browser instance to the MCP clients
allowing them to inspect, debug, and modify any data in the browser or DevTools.
Avoid sharing sensitive or personal information that you don't want to share with
MCP clients.

`chrome-devtools-mcp` officially supports Google Chrome and [Chrome for Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) only.
Other Chromium-based browsers may work, but this is not guaranteed, and you may encounter unexpected behavior. Use at your own discretion.
We are committed to providing fixes and support for the latest version of [Extended Stable Chrome](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule).

Performance tools may send trace URLs to the Google CrUX API to fetch real-user
experience data. This helps provide a holistic performance picture by
presenting field data alongside lab data. This data is collected by the [Chrome
User Experience Report (CrUX)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux). To disable
this, run with the `--no-performance-crux` flag.

## **Usage statistics**

Google collects usage statistics (such as tool invocation success rates, latency, and environment information) to improve the reliability and performance of Chrome DevTools MCP.

Data collection is **enabled by default**. You can opt-out by passing the `--no-usage-statistics` flag when starting the server:

```json
"args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest", "--no-usage-statistics"]
```

Google handles this data in accordance with the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Google's collection of usage statistics for Chrome DevTools MCP is independent from the Chrome browser's usage statistics. Opting out of Chrome metrics does not automatically opt you out of this tool, and vice-versa.

Collection is disabled if `CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_USAGE_STATISTICS` or `CI` env variables are set.

## Update checks

By default, the server periodically checks the npm registry for updates and logs a notification when a newer version is available.
You can disable these update checks by setting the `CHROME_DEVTOOLS_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECKS` environment variable.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.19 or a newer [latest maintenance LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) version.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) current stable version or newer.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting started

Add the following config to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` ensures that your MCP client will always use the latest version of the Chrome DevTools MCP server.
