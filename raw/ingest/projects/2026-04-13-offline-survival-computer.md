Project N.O.M.A.D. is a self-contained, offline-first knowledge and education server packed with critical tools, knowledge, and AI to keep you informed and empowered—anytime, anywhere.

## Installation & Quickstart
Project N.O.M.A.D. can be installed on any Debian-based operating system (we recommend Ubuntu). Installation is completely terminal-based, and all tools and resources are designed to be accessed through the browser, so there's no need for a desktop environment if you'd rather setup N.O.M.A.D. as a "server" and access it through other clients.

*Note: sudo/root privileges are required to run the install script*

### Quick Install (Debian-based OS Only)
```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y curl && \
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad/refs/heads/main/install/install_nomad.sh \
  -o install_nomad.sh && \
sudo bash install_nomad.sh
```

Project N.O.M.A.D. is now installed on your device! Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://DEVICE_IP:8080`) to start exploring!

For a complete step-by-step walkthrough (including Ubuntu installation), see the [Installation Guide](https://www.projectnomad.us/install).

### Advanced Installation
For more control over the installation process, copy and paste the [Docker Compose template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad/refs/heads/main/install/management_compose.yaml) into a `docker-compose.yml` file and customize it to your liking (be sure to replace any placeholders with your actual values). Then, run `docker compose up -d` to start the Command Center and its dependencies. Note: this method is recommended for advanced users only, as it requires familiarity with Docker and manual configuration before starting.

## How It Works
N.O.M.A.D. is a management UI ("Command Center") and API that orchestrates a collection of containerized tools and resources via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It handles installation, configuration, and updates for everything — so you don't have to.
