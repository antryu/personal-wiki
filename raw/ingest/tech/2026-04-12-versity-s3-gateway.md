### Overview
Versity Gateway, a simple to use tool for seamless inline translation between AWS S3 object commands and storage systems. The Versity Gateway bridges the gap between S3-reliant applications and other storage systems, enabling enhanced compatibility and integration while offering exceptional scalability.

The server translates incoming S3 API requests and transforms them into equivalent operations to the backend service. By leveraging this gateway server, applications can interact with the S3-compatible API on top of already existing storage systems. This project enables leveraging existing infrastructure investments while seamlessly integrating with S3-compatible systems, offering increased flexibility and compatibility in managing data storage.

The Versity Gateway is focused on performance, simplicity, and expandability. The Versity Gateway is designed with modularity in mind, enabling future extensions to support additional backend storage systems. At present, the Versity Gateway supports any generic POSIX file backend storage, Versity’s open source ScoutFS filesystem, Azure Blob Storage, and other S3 servers.

The gateway is completely stateless. Multiple Versity Gateway instances may be deployed in a cluster to increase aggregate throughput. The Versity Gateway’s stateless architecture allows any request to be serviced by any gateway thereby distributing workloads and enhancing performance. Load balancers may be used to evenly distribute requests across the cluster of gateways for optimal performance.
