## ✨ Features

- **Model Routing**: Route requests to different models based on your needs (e.g., background tasks, thinking, long context).
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports various model providers like OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini, Volcengine, and SiliconFlow.
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Customize requests and responses for different providers using transformers.
- **Dynamic Model Switching**: Switch models on-the-fly within Claude Code using the `/model` command.
- **CLI Model Management**: Manage models and providers directly from the terminal with `ccr model`.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Trigger Claude Code tasks in your GitHub workflows.
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom transformers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

First, ensure you have [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart) installed:

```shell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then, install Claude Code Router:

```shell
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

### 2. Configuration

Create and configure your `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` file. For more details, you can refer to `config.example.json`.

The `config.json` file has several key sections:

- **`PROXY_URL`** (optional): You can set a proxy for API requests, for example: `"PROXY_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:7890"`.
- **`LOG`** (optional): You can enable logging by setting it to `true`. When set to `false`, no log files will be created. Default is `true`.
- **`LOG_LEVEL`** (optional): Set the logging level. Available options are: `"fatal"`, `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"`, `"trace"`. Default is `"debug"`.
- **Logging Systems**: The Claude Code Router uses two separate logging systems:
  - **Server-level logs**: HTTP requests, API calls, and server events are logged using pino in the `~/.claude-code-router/logs/` directory with filenames like `ccr-*.log`
  - **Application-level logs**: Routing decisions and business logic events are logged in `~/.claude-code-router/claude-code-router.log`
- **`APIKEY`** (optional): You can set a secret key to authenticate requests. When set, clients must provide this key in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer your-secret-key`) or the `x-api-key` header. Example: `"APIKEY": "your-secret-key"`.
- **`HOST`** (optional): You can set the host address for the server. If `APIKEY` is not set, the host will be forced to `127.0.0.1` for security reasons to prevent unauthorized access. Example: `"HOST": "0.0.0.0"`.
- **`NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE`** (optional): When set to `true`, enables compatibility with non-interactive environments like GitHub Actions, Docker containers, or other CI/CD systems. This sets appropriate environm
