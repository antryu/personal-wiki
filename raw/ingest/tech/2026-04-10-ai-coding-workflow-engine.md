Archon is a workflow engine for AI coding agents. Define your development processes as YAML workflows - planning, implementation, validation, code review, PR creation - and run them reliably across all your projects.

Like what Dockerfiles did for infrastructure and GitHub Actions did for CI/CD - Archon does for AI coding workflows. Think n8n, but for software development.

## Why Archon?

When you ask an AI agent to "fix this bug", what happens depends on the model's mood. It might skip planning. It might forget to run tests. It might write a PR description that ignores your template. Every run is different.

Archon fixes this. Encode your development process as a workflow. The workflow defines the phases, validation gates, and artifacts. The AI fills in the intelligence at each step, but the structure is deterministic and owned by you.

- **Repeatable** - Same workflow, same sequence, every time. Plan, implement, validate, review, PR.
- **Isolated** - Every workflow run gets its own git worktree. Run 5 fixes in parallel with no conflicts.
- **Fire and forget** - Kick off a workflow, go do other work. Come back to a finished PR with review comments.
- **Composable** - Mix deterministic nodes (bash scripts, tests, git ops) with AI nodes (planning, code generation, review). The AI only runs where it adds value.
- **Portable** - Define workflows once in `.archon/workflows/`, commit them to your repo. They work the same from CLI, Web UI, Slack, Telegram, or GitHub.

## What It Looks Like

Here's an example of an Archon workflow that plans, implements in a loop until tests pass, gets your approval, then creates the PR:

```yaml
# .archon/workflows/build-feature.yaml
nodes:
  - id: plan
    prompt: "Explore the codebase and create an implementation plan"

  - id: implement
    depends_on: [plan]
    loop:                                      # AI loop - iterate until done
      prompt: "Read the plan. Implement the next task. Run validation."
      until: ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE
      fresh_context: true                      # Fresh session each iteration

  - id: run-tests
    depends_on: [implement]
    bash: "bun run validate"                   # Deterministic - no AI

  - id: review
    depends_on: [run-tests]
    prompt: "Review all changes against the plan. Fix any issues."

  - id: approve
    depends_on: [review]
    loop:                                      # Human approval gate
      prompt: "Present the changes for review. Address any feedback."
      until: APPROVED
      interactive: true                        # Pauses and waits for human input

  - id: create-pr
    depends_on: [approve]
    prompt: "Push changes and create a pull request"
```

Tell your coding agent what you want, and Archon handles the rest:

```
You: Use archon to add dark mode to the settings page

Agent: I'll run the archon-idea-to-pr workflow for this.
       → Creating isolated worktree on branch archon/task-dark-mode...
       → Planning...
       → Implementing (task 1/4)...
       → Implementing (task 2/4)...
       → Tests failing - iterating.
