## About

Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being
fast, feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal
emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed,
features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.

**`libghostty`** is a cross-platform, zero-dependency C and Zig library
for building terminal emulators or utilizing terminal functionality
(such as style parsing). Anyone can use `libghostty` to build a terminal
emulator or embed a terminal into their own applications. See
[Ghostling](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostling) for a minimal complete project
example or the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/tree/main/example)
for smaller examples of using `libghostty` in C and Zig.

For more details, see [About Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/docs/about).

## Roadmap and Status

Ghostty is stable and in use by millions of people and machines daily.

The high-level ambitious plan for the project, in order:

|  #  | Step                                                    | Status |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
|  1  | Standards-compliant terminal emulation                  |   ✅   |
|  2  | Competitive performance                                 |   ✅   |
|  3  | Rich windowing features -- multi-window, tabbing, panes |   ✅   |
|  4  | Native Platform Experiences                             |   ✅   |
|  5  | Cross-platform `libghostty` for Embeddable Terminals    |   ✅   |
|  6  | Ghostty-only Terminal Control Sequences                 |   ❌   |

Additional details for each step in the big roadmap below:

#### Standards-Compliant Terminal Emulation

Ghostty implements all of the regularly used control sequences and
can run every mainstream terminal program without issue. For legacy sequences,
we've done a [comprehensive xterm audit](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/632)
comparing Ghostty's behavior to xterm and building a set of conformance
test cases.

In addition to legacy sequences (what you'd call real "terminal" emulation),
Ghostty also supports more modern sequences than almost any other terminal
emulator. These features include things like the Kitty graphics protocol,
Kitty image protocol, clipboard sequences, synchronized rendering,
light/dark mode notifications, and many, many more.

We believe Ghostty is one of the most compliant and feature-rich terminal
emulators available.

Terminal behavior is partially a de jure standard
(i.e. [ECMA-48](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48/))
but mostly a de facto standard as defined by popular terminal emulators
worldwide. Ghostty takes the approach that our behavior is defined by
(1) standards, if available, (2) xter
