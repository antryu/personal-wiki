## Overview

Hugo is a [static site generator][] written in Go, optimized for speed and designed for flexibility. With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.

Due to its flexible framework, multilingual support, and powerful taxonomy system, Hugo is widely used to create:

- Corporate, government, nonprofit, education, news, event, and project sites
- Documentation sites
- Image portfolios
- Landing pages
- Business, professional, and personal blogs
- Resumes and CVs

Use Hugo's embedded web server during development to instantly see changes to content, structure, behavior, and presentation. Then deploy the site to your host, or push changes to your Git provider for automated builds and deployment.

Hugo's fast asset pipelines include:

- CSS Processing &ndash; Bundle, transform, minify, create source maps, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS.
- Image processing &ndash; Convert, resize, crop, rotate, adjust colors, apply filters, overlay text and images, and extract metadata
- JavaScript bundling &ndash; Transpile TypeScript and JSX to JavaScript, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, and perform SRI hashing.
- Sass processing &ndash; Transpile Sass to CSS, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS
- Tailwind CSS processing &ndash; Compile Tailwind CSS utility classes into standard CSS, bundle, tree shake, optimize, minify, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with Pos
