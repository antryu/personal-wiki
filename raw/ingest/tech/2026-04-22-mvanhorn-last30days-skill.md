**An AI agent-led search engine scored by upvotes, likes, and real money - not editors.**

This README tracks the current v3 pipeline. The runtime skill spec lives in [skills/last30days/SKILL.md](skills/last30days/SKILL.md), which is the source of truth for the latest command and setup behavior.

Claude Code:
```
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/last30days-skill
```

OpenClaw:
```
clawhub install last30days-official
```

Hermes:
```
# The skill auto-deploys when you run sync.sh
# Or manually copy to ~/.hermes/skills/research/last30days/
```

Zero config. Reddit, HN, Polymarket, and GitHub work immediately. Run it once and the setup wizard unlocks X, YouTube, TikTok, and more in 30 seconds.

---

Reddit upvotes. X likes. YouTube transcripts. TikTok engagement. Polymarket odds backed by real money and insider information. That's millions of people voting with their attention and their wallets every day. /last30days searches all of it in parallel, scores it by what real people actually engage with, and an AI agent judge synthesizes it into one brief.

Google aggregates editors. /last30days searches people.

You can't get this search anywhere else because no single AI has access to all of it. Google search doesn't touch Reddit comments or X posts. ChatGPT has a deal with Reddit but can't search X or TikTok. Gemini has YouTube but not Reddit. Claude has none of them natively. Each platform is a walled garden with its own API, its own tokens, its own auth. But you can bring your own keys and browser sessions, and suddenly an AI agent can search all of them at once, score them against each other, and tell you what actually matters.

That's the unlock. Not one better search engine. A dozen disconnected platforms, bridged by an agent.

You have a meeting tomorrow. You Google them. You get their LinkedIn from 2023. /last30days gives you what they're actually doing this month: joined OpenAI to work on Codex, fighting Anthropic's ban on third-party agents, shipping 23 PRs at 85% merge rate, building "LobsterOS" for cross-device agent control, and r/ClaudeCode hit 569 upvotes debating whether he's a hero or "insufferable." Scattered across X posts, Reddit threads, YouTube transcripts, and GitHub commits. None of it was on Google.

## Why this exists

I built it to keep up in AI. Everything changes every day and the Reddit and X nerds are always on top of it first. I needed better prompts, and the training data was always months behind what the community had already figured out.

But it turned into something bigger. Now I run it before a sales call to know the last 30 days truth about a business. Before a meeting to read someone's recent tweets and podcast transcripts. Before a Disney World trip to know which rides are closed and what the community says about Genie+. Before I build anything to know what problems people are actually hitting.

If you're meeting with a CEO, have you read all their tweets and YouTube transcripts from the last 30 days? I have.
